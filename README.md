# AniClass

## To run this code, download the Aniclass.ipynb file. Next, use this link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10?resource=download) to download the dataset. 
## After obtaining the dataset as a .zip file, change the directories in the code to match YOUR computer's directory. 

### '/Users/trevordang/Downloads/CECS456-Final/CECS456-Animal-Dataset.zip' should be changed to '.../archive.zip'.

### '/Users/trevordang/Downloads/CECS456-Final/animal_images/raw-img' should be changed to '.../animal_images/raw-img'. 

### From there the code should be ready to test and run! Have fun!
